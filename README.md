# Netflix-Matrix-Completion

Project completed with Joe Janssen (joej1997) for CPSC 536M. The goal was to complete low-rank matrices representing data from Netflix (user ratings) in order to recommend movies to users according to their preferences. A detailed paper outlining techniques and our results is included in the repository.
