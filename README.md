# Netflix-Matrix-Completion

Project completed with Joe Janssen (@joej1997) for CPSC 536M. The goal was to complete low-rank matrices representing data from Netflix (user ratings) in order to recommend movies to users according to their preferences. Netflix data was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data. The code for completing the netflix data is in netflix_testing.R. To run it, you need to download the Netflix data and change the file path in the code appropriately. Synthetic testing for our algorithm on randomly generated sparse matrices was done in synthetic_testing.py. A detailed paper outlining techniques and our results is included in the repository.
